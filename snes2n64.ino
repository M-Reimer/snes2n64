/**
 * SNES controller to Nintendo 64 adapter
 * by Manuel Reimer (based on GC to N64 adapter by Andrew Brown)
 */

/**
 * To use, hook up the following to the Arduino Duemilanove:
 * Digital I/O 2: Gamecube controller serial line
 * Digital I/O 8: N64 serial line
 * All appropriate grounding and power lines
 * A 1K resistor to bridge digital I/O 2 and the 3.3V supply
 *
 * The pin-out for the N64 and Gamecube wires can be found here:
 * http://svn.navi.cx/misc/trunk/wasabi/devices/cube64/hardware/cube64-basic.pdf
 * Note: that diagram is not for this project, but for a similar project which
 * uses a PIC microcontroller. However, the diagram does describe the pinouts
 * of the gamecube and N64 wires.
 *
 * Also note: the N64 supplies a 3.3 volt line, but I don't plug that into
 * anything.  The arduino can't run off of that many volts, it needs more, so
 * it's powered externally. Additionally, the arduino has its own 3.3 volt
 * supply that I use to power the Gamecube controller. Therefore, only two lines
 * from the N64 are used.
